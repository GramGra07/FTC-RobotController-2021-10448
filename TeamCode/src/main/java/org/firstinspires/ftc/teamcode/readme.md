## TeamCode Module

Welcome to team 10448's GitHub repo where we have all of the tools and working opModes for the Freight Frenzy 2021-2022 season.
Please do not make any changes without notifying or telling me, I will review all pushes and either confirm or deny them.
During this season we used a camera and push sensors to determine field positioning. We dabbled in encoders but there is no working encoder code in this repo.
